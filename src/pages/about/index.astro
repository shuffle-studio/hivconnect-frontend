              The Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) stands as a testament to over three decades of dedication in offering a comprehensive system of care across the U.S. Born out of the urgent need to address the public health challenges posed by the HIV pandemic, the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency (CARE) Act was established in 1990.

            <p class="mb-6">
              The program has since undergone reauthorizations in 1996, 2000, and 2009, with each phase bringing renewed focus. The 2009 reauthorization, known as the Ryan White Treatment and Modernization Act, emphasized targeting heavily impacted communities and ensuring retention in care.

Switching to a clinic, having appointments in a temporary trailer, and feeling like just another number were all challenges I faced. But the hardest part was the side effects of the medications, which made it difficult for me to work and support my son."

I realized I needed to get back into care, not just for me but for my son. That's when I discovered RWJ and the Ryan White Program. The support I received was unparalleled. From a doctor who genuinely cared about my well-being to a nurse who helped me navigate my appointments and introduced me to a women's support group."

The program also assisted me with legal services, ensuring I had a living will and power of attorney in place."

              The Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon Transitional Grant Area Ryan White Part A HIV/AIDS Health Services Planning Council is a panel appointed by the Middlesex County Commission in New Jersey. They plan how to serve people living with HIV/AIDS in the neighborhood. This is accomplished with federal funds expressly designated to assist communities affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

They accomplish this by determining what services are required and then deciding how to use federal funds to provide those services. The TGA serves a number of counties in central New Jersey.
